# The examples of the Content Models for the Universal Data Structure initiative.

The content models can be described on the base of files formats:
- json
- yml

There will be the root document with the references to the descriptions of the other data objects.
By deafault the name of the file = root.json, or it can be set in the first line of README.md.

The content model can be extended from the other content model.

The data object inside it can be extended form the other data object.
